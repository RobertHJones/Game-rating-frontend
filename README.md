# Robert Jones Game Rating App

This app is to keep track of all the games I've played, and what I thought of then. You can search for games by different parameters and add in new ones. I originally made this project over Christmas in Vanilla JavaScript and am now refactoring the frontend into TypeScript and React.

## FAQ

#### Why can't I search by multiple parameters?

I may choose to add this in, but due to the number of games in the database not being that high yet I feel that the search function is currently best served by operating individually for each parameter.

#### Why do I have to add by your specified genres, rather than add my own one in?

This is just for consistency. It should be a fairly comprehensive list of genres but you can get in touch if you think I'm missing anything.
